1) Project Description -: This project is about investing the metrics and generating the insights from the data , There are  3 tables in the file .  First I tried to learn that what kind of data is available in the tables and then tried to answers the questions like if the users find the quality in the product and what is the user growth over weekly basis etc. 
2) Approach -: Initially I tried to understand the data and study it thoroughly to get the understanding of data by running some basic SQL queries. After I get comfortable with data, I started to look for answers to questions.
3) Tech-Stack Used -:  I used MY SQL to complete this project because I am comfortable using it.
4)  Insights -: I found that the user weekly engagement was more at starting weeks and it drop down in last weeks and the average weekly retention of the customer is 2 weeks. The email open rate is 36 percent and email click rate is 16 percent for users.
